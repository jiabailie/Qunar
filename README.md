An image recognition project for qunar.com. <br />
<h4>This is a tentative project, which won't be used for any commercial use.</h4>
<h5>Main idea</h5>
1. Using feature points to do recognition.<br />
2. There are two kinds of feature points: black points and white points. Since each character must has black part and white part, thus it appears as a character.<br />
3. Give white points more score than black points. Since the disturbing line is black, so there are two many redundant black points in the image, so white points are more important.<br />
4. To the disturbing line, using the idea of calculous. Since the line can be considered as a continuous function.<br />
<br />
This project hasn't been completed, there are still some things left. <br />
Such as, how to remove the disturbing line perfectly, and is there other ways to do character segment.<br />
After all, this is a tentative project, and the original idea of identifying code is making sure that there is no way to recognize the character using computer.<br />
