An image recognition project for qunar.com. <br />
<h4>This is a tentative project, which won't be used for any commercial use.</h4> <br />

Main idea<br />
1. Using feature points to do recognition.<br />
2. There are two kinds of feature points: black points and white points. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since each character must has black part and white part, thus it appears as a character.<br />
3. Give white points more score than black points.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the disturbing line is black, so there are two many redundant black points in the image, so white points are more important.<br />
4. To the disturbing line, using the idea of calculous.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the line can be considered as a continuous function.<br />
